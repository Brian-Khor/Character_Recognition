# Character_Recognition

This project is based on the online dataset found on Kaggle. The link to the csv and jpg files is the following (it's 1GB worth of data size!):

The notebook can be run chronologically to get the results and graphs shown. This is a very large dataset, so again one needs GPU to run the code (for example, on Kaggle). If you wish to run the project, the slight change you need to make is to change the file's path to match your local path file after you downloaded the csv file.

The link of my original Kaggle notebook is as follows:
